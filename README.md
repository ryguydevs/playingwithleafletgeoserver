# playingwithleafletgeoserver
I created a postgresql db of Idaho River. Then used that to create a WMS on a local instance of Geoserver. From there I used qgis2web to create a leaflet map. I'm curious what happens to my layer since geoserver is local.

The rivers layer from Geoserver shows up fine on my computer but not on other computers. Which is what I thought would happen since it's a locally hosted instance of Geoserver.
